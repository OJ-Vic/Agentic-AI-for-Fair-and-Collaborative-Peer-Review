1. **Comparative Analysis**: Review [A] emphasizes the lack of comparative analysis with other multimodal fusion techniques or baseline models, while Reviews [B] and [C] do not explicitly mention this as a weakness.
2. **Dataset Limitation**: Review [A] highlights the limitation of using a single multimodal database of 400 individuals, whereas Reviews [B] and [C] do not explicitly address this issue.

#### Final Recommendation
Given the consensus on the strengths and the acknowledged limitations, particularly the small dataset size, the overall evaluation leans towards recommending against the publication of the paper. The system's novelty and feature enhancement are commendable, but the lack of robust comparative analysis and the potential limitations due to the small dataset size make it difficult to confidently recommend the paper for publication.
